this principle states that a class is close to modification but open to extension
meaning that a base class implemented should not be modified but just extended
In this example we would want to calculate the salary of developers.

The initial solution is to create a developer class and calculate it on a Salary Calculator, but what if different positions has different percentage of salary calculations?

Let say a Senior position has its salary multiplied to 1.5 but the junior has none. 

initial solution is to create a conditional statements on the salary Calculator, but what if more positions have different multipliers?

But with Open Close Principle the solution is to create an abstract Class BaseSalaryCalculator, and then create a class for each position and inherit from BaseSalaryCalculator
