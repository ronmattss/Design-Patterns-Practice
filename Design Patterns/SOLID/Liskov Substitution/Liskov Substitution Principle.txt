Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 
is a principle that states that objects should be replaceable with instances of their base classes without breaking the correctness of that program.
Open Close Principle partially applies this but it is prone to errors from it's subtypes. 
The solution for this is to create an interface for the main functionalities as a base for the subtypes such that every implemented subtypes will not break the program.

This example will use a Page Roles model to demonstrate the LSP principle.
The roles implemented are: Admin, Editor, and Viewer

Admin Role has these functions:
- Create posts
- Edit posts
- View posts
Editor Role has these functions:
- Edit posts
- View posts
Viewer Role has this function:
- View posts

which will all be an instance of Role class
