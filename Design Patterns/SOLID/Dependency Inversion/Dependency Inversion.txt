This principle states that low-level components should not depend on high-level components. Both should depend on abstractions.
Basically stating that the components should be independent of each other.
Meaning that components should be decoupled from each other.

In this case creating instances of other classes in the higher level component is not a good idea.
what we do is create a Factory class where all instances will be created. Then call the factory method to create the instance.
In this way we can decouple Higher level components from lower level components.
